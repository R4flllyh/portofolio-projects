   - [x] Clean up variable naming and add detailed JSDoc comments
   - [x] Add null checks and validation for all DOM elements
   - [x] Improve intersection observer with better configuration
   - [x] Add proper cleanup methods for memory management

3. **Styling Enhancements**: ✅
   - [x] Optimize CSS animations with hardware acceleration (translateZ(0))
   - [x] Improve responsive breakpoints (added 1024px, 480px breakpoints)
   - [x] Add subtle visual enhancements (enhanced shadows, border highlights)
   - [x] Optimize media queries organization with clear sections
   - [x] Add accessibility improvements (prefers-reduced-motion, high-contrast)

   - [x] Add backface-visibility: hidden for better rendering
   - [x] Implement proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks

## 🎯 Goals - ACHIEVED:
- ✅ Keep the same visual design (no visual changes, only improvements)
- ✅ Improve code quality and readability (better structure, comments, error handling)
- ✅ Enhance performance and accessibility (hardware acceleration, ARIA labels, reduced motion)
- ✅ Better responsive behavior (more breakpoints, better mobile experience)

## 🚀 Additional Improvements Made:
- Enhanced error handling with try-catch blocks
- Better memory management with proper cleanup
- Improved accessibility with semantic HTML and ARIA attributes
- Added support for reduced motion preferences
- Enhanced responsive design with more breakpoints
- Better performance with hardware acceleration
- Added print styles for better document printing
- Improved code documentation with JSDoc comments

## 📝 Next Steps:
- [x] Test component in browser to verify all improvements work correctly
- [x] Verify responsive design across different screen sizes
- [x] Test accessibility features with screen readers
- [x] Validate performance improvements

## 🔧 Skills.vue Image Fix - COMPLETED:
- [x] Fixed image path issues for deployment
- [x] Changed from string paths to proper ES6 imports
- [x] Used `@/assets/images/` alias for better Vite compatibility
- [x] Ensured all images will be properly processed during build
- [x] Verified all image files exist in assets folder

### Technical Changes Made:
- Replaced `/src/assets/images/filename.png` with proper imports
- Used ES6 import statements for all technology logos
- Applied `@/` alias for cleaner import paths
- This ensures Vite will:
  - Process and optimize images during build
  - Generate proper hashed filenames for caching
  - Include images in the final build output
  - Work correctly when deployed to any server

### Images Fixed:
- ✅ Figma-logo.png
- ✅ git-logo.png  
- ✅ javascript-logo.png
- ✅ HTML-logo.png
- ✅ CSS-logo.png
- ✅ laravel-logo.png
- ✅ tailwind-logo.png
- ✅ Flutter-logo.png
- ✅ dart-logo.png
- ✅ Wordpress_Blue_logo.png

## 🎯 Final Status:
- ✅ About.vue improvements completed (accessibility, performance, responsive design)
- ✅ Skills.vue image deployment fix completed
- ✅ All components ready for production deployment
